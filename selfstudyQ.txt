If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?

	I would say that you have to think of semantic HTML as elements or tags that describe where

while <footer> will be at the bottom of each webpage.


Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.

Inline will only take up the neccessary amount of width while Block will take up all the width available to it.

Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.

	Its vaulable because you have a whole history of changes/commits you as a developer did and to go back a refrence
this is a huge plus with work flow. Also having an amazing feature to work collaboratively such as the ability to make branches
helps making clean sleek product quality code, since the master branch goes untouched untill merges are approved. Which makes
it amazing for a developer as they have copies they can tweak without the fear of compleletly obliterating the teams work. Git
also has a huge community behind it so knowing Git will make it easier to get into the heart of a project when starting off with 
a new job or team.
